## How to Install
* Use the Flasher: [Launcher Flasher](https://bmorcelli.github.io/Launcher/).
* Use M5Burner, or
* Download the .bin file from Releases for your device and use https://web.esphome.io/ or esptool.py to flash the file `Launcher-{YourDevice}.bin` to your device.

## How to Use
* Turn your device on
* Press M5/Sel (Enter) on the Launcher start screen to get into Launcher
* Choose OTA to install new binaries from online services (M5Burner or GitHub links)
* After installation, when you turn on the device, the installed program will launch if you don't press anything.

## My SD Card doesn't work!
* Make sure your SD card is SDHC (not SDXC)
* Use a maximum size of 32GB (I use 8 or 16GB)
* Format it as FAT32 (use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) to format your SD card)
* Ensure the partition scheme is MBR, not GPT

## With Launcher you'll be able to:

  <summary><h3>Tips</h3></summary>
* Having an SD card gives you a better experience, but it is not required. [SD Card Hat for M5StickCs](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6459069)
* You can learn more about how it works on the [Launcher Wiki](https://github.com/bmorcelli/Launcher/wiki/Explaining-the-project).
* Where/how do I find binaries to launch? -> [Obtaining binaries to launch](https://github.com/bmorcelli/Launcher/wiki/Obtaining-binaries-to-launch)
* Now you can download binaries from [HERE!](https://bmorcelli.github.io/Launcher/catalog.html)
</details>

## Known Issues
* UiFlow 1 doesn't work with Launcher. It uses an old MicroPython distro, which uses an old ESP-IDF distro with lots of secrets that I couldn't figure out.

## To-Do list
Things that need to be done in future updates

* [ ] LVGL UI (?)
* [ ] Move to ESP-IDF Platform
* [ ] Optimize Settings functions to save flash
* [ ] Optimize Storage functions to save Flash

## Latest Changelog
* 2.8.0:
     * [x] Port to Xueersi-XiaoMiao
     * [x] Lilygo T-Watch-Ultra now has OTA installing
     * [x] **Shortcut system for Keyboard devices**: Devices with Keyboard can bind a binary to a key, and install it with the press of one key from Main menu
     * [x] **Fastboot for Keyboard and Touchscreen devices**: On bootscreen you can press a key or touch the screen to fast boot into an installed firmware
     * [x] **Added Serial interface**: type "help" on serial to check available commands, you can configure Wifi from there, useful for devices like StickCPlus2 and others without keyboard or touchscreen: e.g. "wifi add MyNetworkSSID MyN37w0rkPWD", calibrate touchscreen, mirror X/Y axis or swap XY axis.
     * [x] **Downloaded firmware update list**. Now launcher can check the firmware you downloaded, stored at `{dwn_path}/downloaded.json` and check if there are new versions of these firmwares, and it can download all new files directly to your SDCard if you hit `[Update All]`.
     * [x] **Multi-part binary download**: Firmware composed by multiple files (bootloader.bin, partitions.bin, firmware.bin and data.bin) available on LauncherHub are now downloaded and merged at runtime. It fetches data, one by one, and saves them into on single file to be flashed from the SDCard.
     * [x] **New Data partition Backup system**: Now it saves the relationship between backup and binary on `/bkp/backupData.json` and restores it when reinstalling. App icon will display backup data, and PMan too. Needs SD Card to use this feature.
     * [x] **WebUI** now shows partitioning info and allows partition management.
     * [x] **Added support to M5 CardKB2, CardKB 1.1 and Tab5 keyboard**. Support was added to M5 devices using grove I2C Port A for: StickC, StickCPlus 1.1, StickCPlus2, StickS3, Tab5, CoreS3, Core2 and Core, Thanks to @cddigi
     * [x] Fixed unheld traffic on TSL 1.3 networks with proper error handling, thanks to @anton-vinogradov
     * [x] Data partitions are now created with the label set in the partition table, and added compatibility to xiaozhi-esp32, that needs more SPIFFS storage, thanks to @QQSHI13
     * [x] Firmware containing valid data partitions now have their data partition copied as is. Empty partitions are created with minimum size of 0x70000 (448kb) or filling the flash if passes the threshold size.
     * [x] FAT labeled "sys" and "system" are now copied entirely, and the other partitions (FAT or LittleFS) are properly copied and resized to avoid being re-formatted, it gives compatibility to UiFlow, Tactility and some other firmware.
     * [x] E-paper displays now show "Powered Off" when turned off by launcher.
     * [x] Optimized RAM, reducing Heap fragmentation
